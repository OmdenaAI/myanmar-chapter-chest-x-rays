    which has caused significant loss of life and economic disruptions across nations. As one of the most effective 
    tools for identifying COVID-19, chest X-rays have played a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring the 
    progression of the disease. However, the manual interpretation of these images by healthcare professionals can be 
    time-consuming and subjective, often leading to delays in diagnosis and potential errors.<br><br> In addition to 
    COVID-19, there are numerous other respiratory and chest-related diseases that require accurate and timely 
    detection, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. Early detection of these diseases is vital for 
    effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Unfortunately, healthcare systems in many parts of the world, 
    including Myanmar, face resource constraints, limited access to specialized expertise, and a lack of 
    sophisticated diagnostic tools. These challenges hinder the timely detection and appropriate management of 
    respiratory diseases, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. <br><br>To address these critical 
    issues, the Omdena Myanmar Chapter has initiated the “Identifying Diseases in Chest X-Rays & COVID-19 Detection” 
    project. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to develop an automated system capable of accurately 
    detecting COVID-19 and various chest-related diseases from radiographic images. By harnessing the power of 
    artificial intelligence and computer vision, this project aims to revolutionize the diagnostic process and 
    facilitate early intervention, ultimately saving lives and improving healthcare outcomes.</p><br>

PROJECT_GOALS = f"""<h2>Project goals</h2> <p>The project's primary objective is to create an AI-driven healthcare 
    solution for chest X-ray analysis, disease detection, and COVID-19 diagnosis, utilizing deep learning algorithms. 
    To begin, an extensive literature review will be conducted, informing the project's goals. A diverse dataset of 
    chest X-ray images, encompassing COVID-19 cases and other chest diseases, will be collected and preprocessed for 
    model training. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to reveal insights and potential 
    biases.<br><br>Choosing the most appropriate deep learning algorithm or architecture will be a key step, 
    considering factors such as complexity, interpretability, and computational requirements. The selected model will 
    be implemented, trained, and optimized to achieve precise disease detection. Additionally, a user-friendly web or 
    mobile app will be developed to provide real-time results for uploaded chest X-ray images.<br><br>The final 
    solution will be deployed in a secure, scalable hosting environment. Comprehensive project documentation and a 
    final presentation will be delivered to showcase results and the solution's potential impact on healthcare. 
    Knowledge sharing and open discussions about AI-driven healthcare solutions will be encouraged.</p> """

PROJECT_PROBLEM = f"""<h2>The Problem</h2> <p>The problem we aim to solve through this project is two-fold. Firstly,
    the lack of accessible and reliable diagnostic tools for chest diseases, including COVID-19, hampers timely
    detection and intervention, which can lead to the rapid spread of the disease and its associated complications.
    Secondly, the scarcity of specialized healthcare professionals, particularly radiologists, in many parts of
    Myanmar, exacerbates the problem by limiting the availability of accurate and prompt diagnoses. <br><br>Our local
    community faces the burden of inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited resources, which further amplifies
    the impact of these challenges. Early detection of COVID-19 and other chest diseases is crucial for effective
    treatment and preventing the spread of the virus. By deploying an AI-powered solution capable of accurately
    analyzing chest X-rays and identifying diseases, we can make a significant positive impact on the healthcare
    landscape of Myanmar, Asian countries, and people around the world. <br><br>The deep learning model we develop will
    enable healthcare providers, including general practitioners and healthcare workers in remote areas, to quickly
    identify diseases in chest X-rays. By reducing the dependence on scarce human resources and improving the
    efficiency of diagnoses, our solution will enhance the overall quality of healthcare services. Moreover,
    the availability of a reliable and accessible diagnostic tool will empower medical professionals to make informed
    decisions and provide timely treatments, potentially saving lives and mitigating the spread of diseases within
    the community. **The productivity of our product will increase as much as the support we receive**, as our model
    is greatly dependent on the support of data. <br><br>Through the development of a web app or mobile app, we aim to make
    this solution widely accessible beyond our local community, reaching healthcare providers globally. By
    democratizing access to advanced diagnostic capabilities, we strive to contribute to the global fight against
    COVID-19 and other chest diseases, fostering a healthier future for individuals worldwide.<br>
